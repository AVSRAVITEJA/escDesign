# escDesign
This file consists the schematic of an ESC and its PCB design in KICAD 
The electronic speed controller (ESC) is an essential part of an electric propulsion system's hardware. It acts like the brain of the system by telling the motor how fast to go based on data signals it receives from the flight controller. ESCs are available for either brushed (DC) or brushless (AC) motors. Brushed motors are most commonly used in toy-class planes, multicopters, rovers, boats, and balance bots. Most other larger vehicles use brushless speed controllers.
